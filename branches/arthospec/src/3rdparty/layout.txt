3rdparty is organized as follows:

/extlibs
Contains the zipped 3rd party libraries as downloaded from the owners website or sourceforge.

/builds
Unzipped versions of 3rd party libaries that include VC8 solutions to build libs and DLLs in different configurations and platforms (win32, x64, debug, release). Object (*.obj) files should be deleted.

/api
This includes all used header files and libs that belong to the API of 3rd party library and that are neccessary to succesfully build an project that uses this library (in all its configurations and platforms). Unneccessary headers and libs that are not directly used should be ommitted. 3rd party DLLs are copied into the bin directory (in our case the main root) where the exe files are in. The solution accesses headers and libs here.

All 3rd party libraries should be noted with their disclaimer/copyright text in Acknowledgements.txt found in the src main root.
